# Car-Sales-Analysis-PowerBI
## Overview
Our car dealership needs a Power BI dashboard to track and analyze sales performance. The dashboard will visualize key KPIs, including total sales, average price trends, and cars sold metrics. It will provide real-time insights to monitor progress and identify growth opportunities. Visuals like line charts, pie charts, and maps will highlight sales trends by time, body style, color, and region. This interactive tool will enhance data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.

## Key Insights
-- •	KPI Overview: Year-to-date (YTD) sales stand at $371M, reflecting a $71M increase compared to the previous year, with a 23.59% year-over-year (YoY) growth rate. Despite a negative average YTD sales due to a price decrease from the previous year, this does not indicate a loss. A total of 13K cars have been sold YTD, marking a difference of 2,616 units from last year.
-- •	Sales Trends: There was a decline in sales at the start of the year (Week 1) to $229K, followed by another drop around Weeks 31 & 32, with sales of $774K and $776K, respectively. However, a significant increase occurred between Weeks 48–50, peaking at $25M in Week 50. Sales then declined, reaching $10M in Week 53. These fluctuations may be linked to external factors such as public holidays, strikes, or festive periods.
-- •	Car Body Style Performance: SUVs recorded the highest sales, totaling $171M, while hardtops had the lowest at $87M. Female customers predominantly purchased hatchbacks and SUVs, with total sales of $36M each, whereas male customers made the most purchases in SUVs ($135M) and hatchbacks ($130M).
-- •	Car Color Sales Distribution: White cars had the highest sales share at 46.07%, followed by black (33.42%) and red (20.51%).
-- •	Regional Sales Performance: The Austin region led in sales with $117M, likely due to effective customer acquisition strategies, while Middletown had the lowest sales at $87M.
-- •	Top-Selling Brands: Chevrolet had the highest YTD sales, totaling $27M, while Jaguar had the lowest, at just $2K. This also indicates that Chevrolet had the highest number of cars sold, whereas Jaguar had the least.

## Recommendations
1.	Fixing the Drop in Average Sales
-- •	Since the decline in average YTD sales is due to a price reduction, evaluate whether the price cut is leading to increased volume or if adjustments are needed. Consider targeted promotions instead of blanket price reductions.
-- •	Encourage buyers to upgrade to better models or add extra features to make up for the lower prices.
2.	Managing Sales Fluctuations
-- •	 Boost Sales During Low-Performing Weeks: Implement targeted marketing campaigns or special offers around Week 1 and Weeks 31–32 to prevent early-year slumps and mid-year declines.
-- •	 Leverage Seasonal Trends: Since sales spiked in Weeks 48–50 (likely due to festive seasons), plan aggressive holiday promotions, financing offers, and limited-time discounts to maximize revenue.
-- •	  Optimize Inventory Management: Ensure stock availability aligns with high-demand periods to avoid missed sales opportunities.
3.	Focusing on Popular Car Types
-- •	SUVs are the best-selling car type, so dealerships should promote them more with easy financing and trade-in options.
-- •	Since women prefer SUVs and hatchbacks, and men prefer SUVs and hatchbacks, marketing should target these preferences with ads and dealership offers.
4.	Stocking the Right Car Colors
-- •	White, black, and red cars sell the most. Dealers should keep more of these colors in stock to meet customer demand.
-- •	Consider letting customers pre-order specific colors if they want something different.
5.	Helping Low-Performing Regions
-- •	The Austin region has the highest sales. Other regions, like Middletown, should learn from Austin’s marketing and sales strategies.
-- •	Dealerships in low-selling areas should offer special deals or better financing to attract more buyers.
6.	Boosting Car Brand Performance
-- •	Chevrolet sells the most cars, while Jaguar sells the least. Jaguar should get more attention with better marketing, discounts, or financing options.
-- •	Since Chevrolet is already doing well, dealers should stock more of its models and create more promotions to maintain strong sales.
